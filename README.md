# TeamFormations

## Team name: Team Sparkle Rockets

## Robot name: Spark

### Robot Purpose Statement: 
We decided that our robot will be stationary. The robot's function is to be able to pick up the rocket, place it on a launching area and be able to launch the rocket in the air and potentially if the we are able to achieve the stationary part well it will become mobile to retrieve the rocket.
