# TeamFormations

## Team name: Team Sparkle Rockets 
(the reason we choose this name is because it fit a flashy objective like ours, aka, rocket launching. We also debated weather or not we could add a glitter despencer to our rockets to add a little fun)

## Robot name: Spark

### Robot Purpose Statement: 
The robot's function is to be able to pick up the rocket, place it on a launching area and be able to launch the rocket. It will become mobile to retrieve the rocket, though the speed might be slow.
