# TeamFormations

## Team name: Team Sparkle Rockets 
(the reason we choose this name is because it fit a flashy objective like ours, aka, rocket launching. We also debated weather or not we could add a glitter dispenser to our rockets to add a little fun)

## Robot name: Spark
(we chose this name because we thought it would match 'Team Sparkle Rockets' and be fitting for a robot)

### Robot Purpose Statement: 
The robot's function is to be able to pick up a rocket, place it inisde the launching area (inside the robot) and be able to launch the rocket. It will become mobile to retrieve the rocket, though the speed might be slow. The robot should be in a u-shape with a pressure chamber inside to launch the rocket. For grabbing the rocket, we could use a retracting claw that would go through the middle and it would need the ability to move out of the way for the rocket to be put in place. The base of the robot should be heavy or have some way to clip onto the ground so that nothing would move while launching.
